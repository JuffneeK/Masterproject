# Text Classification for Problem Reporting in Bangkok's Traffy Fondue System

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Master's project, "Text Classification for Problem Reporting in Bangkok's Traffy Fondue System." The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- To study problem classification using natural language processing.
- To solve problems identifying the type of problem report.
- To compare the performance of different models.

## Models Used

In this project, we employed the following machine learning models for text classification:

- **Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)**

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**

- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

## Results

Here are the results obtained from our text classification project:

### Accuracy

- **Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)**
  - Accuracy: 90.10%
  - Marco Average: 86.30%
  - Weighted Average: 90.00%
  - Processing Time: 5 minutes

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
  - Accuracy: 99.70%
  - Marco Average: 99.60%
  - Weighted Average: 99.70%
  - Processing Time: 168 minutes

- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
  - Accuracy: 52.80%
  - Marco Average: 42.10%
  - Weighted Average: 50.20%
  - Processing Time: 10 minutes

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
  - Accuracy: 95.60%
  - Marco Average: 94.60%
  - Weighted Average: 95.60%
  - Processing Time: 20 minutes

These results demonstrate the performance of different models in our text classification project. LSTM achieved the highest accuracy, while DNN had the lowest accuracy but the fastest processing time.
